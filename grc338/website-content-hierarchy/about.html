                        <h3>Our Story</h3>
                        <p>In 2017, we expanded onto Taraval with a new cafe right next to the beach and a brand new roasting facility.  When we moved the roasting out of our Lawton cafe, we were able to remodel the kitchen and expand our bakery to provide pastries for all locations. We now have three locations in the Outer Sunset and one location downtown.

As we grow, we are building a team of experienced coffee and pastry professionals who work hard and continuously challenge us to improve. We aim to create the jobs we always wanted to have and the company we always wanted to work for, all in the neighborhood we call home.</p>
