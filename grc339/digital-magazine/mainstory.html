                <h2>Cross this unforgettable bridge into iconic Big Sur</h2>

                <p>
                    Welcome to Big Sur’s version of the Golden Gate—a must-see road trip spot for many and probably the most Instagrammed feature along the Highway 1 coastline. And rightly so. Pull over at numerous turnouts to get amazing views, particularly from the bridge’s south end at sunset. 
                    
                    Big Sur is a majestic stretch of land located off the famous Pacific Coast Highway. Bordered by the Santa Lucia Mountains and the Pacific Ocean, Big Sur offers unmatched scenic beauty and an eclectic vibe you can't find anywhere else. The area is famous for it's breathtaking coastline, towering redwoods and epic hiking trails, as well as its world-class hotels, inns, boutique shops, restaurants, and its parks.

Today (as always) the bridge is a favourite attraction for photographers, from professionals to those in search of the ultimate depth-of-field selfie. But whether you are snapping away or not, be sure to take advantage of the multiple viewpoints; they are key for revelling in 360-degree views instead of just the direction you are going.

                <p>
The overlook trail for McWay Falls is a must-stop for anyone taking the scenic drive up Highway One along the Big Sur Coast. The waterfall is stunning, dropping some 80 feet onto a pristine beach in an enchanting cove. It is a short 0.6-mile round trip hike to a viewpoint for McWay Falls, which can be reached directly from Highway One or from parking areas withing Julia Pfieffer Burns State Park.
McWay Falls Overlook Trail can be accessed two different ways. Option one is to simply park along Highway One for free and start down the trail. You may also pull into Julia Pfeiffer Burns State Park and pay an entrance fee to walk a bit farther. This is a good option if you plan to spend more time in the park, hiking Canyon Trail for example, which travels inland up McWay Creek past a picnic area to the smaller Canyon Falls.

                    Down the Highway 1 from Big Sur is another beach town- Cayucos. Just west of Cayucos, along the coastline and the Pacific Coast Highway, is a fascinating shipwreck, in remarkable condition!

The Point Estero was a commercial fishing vessel that had originated from Morro Bay Harbor. On July 28th, 2017, on its way back to Morro Bay, it unfortunately ran aground at the eastern part of Estero Bluff State Park, supposedly due to operator error.

                        <h3>Kayak Down to Morro Bay</h3>
                        <p>
                            There’s no better way to experience Los Osos-Baywood than to kayak the protected waters of the Morro Bay Estuary. This serene body of water spans the southern end of Morro Bay to the shores of Los Osos-Baywood. The estuary’s intersection of freshwater and saltwater supports a remarkably broad ecosystem of plant, insect, and animal species. To paddle a kayak in the Morro Bay Estuary is to enjoy the very best view of them all.
